   - <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/103-monitoring-linux-telemetry>
   - <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/104-monitoring-linux-Influx-Grafana>

2. While completing each lab think about the following:

   - a. How does it tie into the diagram below?
   - b. What could you improve, or what would you change based on your previous administration experience.

### Conclusion

---

In the end monitoring is more an art than engineering. Sure, we can design all the systems to track all
the things, but thereâ€™s no equation on what is the one right answer for any of this. You have to spend
time with the systems, know what is important and what is an indicator of problems. Then, you have to
consider your audience and how to best show them what they need to see.

> Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.
