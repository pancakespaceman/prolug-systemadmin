#### Discussion Post 1

Refer to your Unit 5 scan of the systems.

You know that Ansible is a tool that you want to maintain in the environment. Review this

1. Make an inventory of the servers, grouped any way you like.
2. What format did you choose to use for your inventory?
3. What other things might you include later in your inventory to make it more useful?

#### Discussion Post 2

<blockquote>

You have been noticing drift on your server configurations, so you want a way to generate a report on them every day to validate the configurations are the same.

</blockquote>
