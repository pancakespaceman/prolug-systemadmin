### Warmup Exercises

Quickly run through your system and familiarize yourself:

```bash
mkdir /root/ansible_madness
cd /root/ansible_madness
dnf whatprovides ansible   # Where is Ansible installed from?
ansible --version          # What version of Ansible is installed?
ansible-<TAB>              # What other ansible-* tools are available?
ansible localhost -m shell -a uptime  # Compare with standalone `uptime`
ansible -vvv localhost -m shell -a uptime  # What extra info does -vvv show?
```

### Lab Exercises

#### Create an Inventory File

While in `/root/ansible_madness`, create a file called `hosts`:

```bash
vi /root/ansible_madness/hosts
```

Add the following contents:

```ini
[servers]
192.168.200.101
192.168.200.102
192.168.200.103
```

### Run Ad Hoc Commands

#### Test connectivity into the servers:

```bash
ansible servers -i hosts -u inmate -k -m shell -a uptime
```

- Use password: `LinuxR0cks1!`

Verbose version:

```bash
ansible -vvv servers -i hosts -u inmate -k -m shell -a uptime
```

#### Create a Playbook to Push Files

1. Create a test file:

```bash
echo "This is my file <yourname>" > somefile
```

2. Create `deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Start of push playbook
  hosts: servers
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: False
  tasks:
    - name: Copy somefile over at {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic_short }}
      copy:
        src: /root/ansible_madness/somefile
        dest: /tmp/somefile.txt
```

3. Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts -k deploy.yaml
```

4. Verify the file was pushed everywhere:

```bash
ansible servers -i hosts -u inmate -k -m shell -a "ls -l /tmp/somefile"
```

#### Pull Down a GitHub Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/het-tanis/HPC_Deploy.git
cd HPC_Deploy
```

Then reflect:

- What do you see in here?
- What do you need to learn more about to deploy some of these tools?
- Can you execute some of these? Why or why not?

> Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.
