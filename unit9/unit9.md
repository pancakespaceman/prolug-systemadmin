# Unit 9 - Containerization on Linux

## Overview

In this unit, we dive into the modern world of containerization, focusing on *Podman*,
and open source, daemon-less container engine. As Linux administrators, understanding
containerization is crucial for supporting developers, managing production systems,
and deploying services efficiently.

We'll explore what containers are, how to manage them, and how to build container
images.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
	- Explain what containers are and how they fit into modern Linux system administration
	- Run and manage Podman containers, including starting, stopping, and inspecting
	containers
	- Build custom container images using Dockerfiles and Podman
	- Analyze container processes, logs, and network interactions for troubleshoting

## Relevance & Context

Containerization is a critical part of modern IT, powering development pipelines (CI/CD),
cloud deployments, and microservices. As Linux system administrators, we are expected
to support across development and production environments.

This unit focuses on *Podman*, a secure, rootless, and daemon-less alternative
to Docker, widely used in enterprise environments like Red Hat and Rocky Linux.
Whether you work in a NOC, Devops, or traditional SysAdmin role, understanding
containerization is essential to being an effictive part of any IT team.

## Prerequisites

Befopre starting Unit 9, you should have:
	- Basic understanding of Linux command line and shell operations
	- Familiarity with package management and system services on RHEL-based systems
	- Root or sudo access to a Linux system 
	- Completed previous units on system administration fundamentals
	- Optional but recommended: initial exposure to virtualization or application
	development concepts.
