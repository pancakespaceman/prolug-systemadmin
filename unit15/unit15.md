        <h1>Unit 15 - Troubleshooting</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

---

In this unit, we focus on **incident management, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting frameworks**. These are foundational skills for Linux administrators who are responsible for maintaining system reliability and responding effectively to issues.

You’ll explore structured approaches like the **Scientific Method**, **5 Whys**, **FMEA**, and **PDCA**, as well as methodologies like **Six Sigma**, **TQM**, and systems thinking. We’ll also look at tools for visual problem solving, including the **Fishbone Diagram** and **Fault Tree Analysis**, and discuss how data types play a role in investigations.

## Learning Objectives

---

**By the end of this unit, you will be able to**:

- Apply the **Scientific Method** to real-world troubleshooting scenarios
- Understand and use structured methods like **FMEA**, **5 Whys**, and **PDCA**
- Differentiate between **continuous and discrete data** in diagnostics
- Use visual tools like **Fishbone Diagrams** and **Fault Tree Analysis** to trace causes
- Explain the **OSI model** as it applies to layered troubleshooting
- Leverage concepts from **Six Sigma** and **5S methodology** to organize your workflows
- Document and communicate incidents effectively with post-mortem writeups

## Relevance & Context

---

Troubleshooting is not guesswork — it’s a discipline. Whether you’re debugging a failed deployment or analyzing a high watermark in system performance, incident management requires both technical skill and structured reasoning.

This unit bridges **engineering troubleshooting** and **administrative troubleshooting**, providing multiple models to approach problems methodically. These frameworks are used by professionals across industries to maintain uptime, solve complex problems, and continuously improve system reliability.

## Prerequisites

---

**Before starting Unit 15, you should have**:

- A working knowledge of **Linux system administration**
- Familiarity with logs, alerts, and system metrics
- Understanding of basic **monitoring and baseline performance concepts**
- Comfort using Linux command-line tools and interpreting output
